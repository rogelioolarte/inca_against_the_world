# Inca against the world
A mod for Europa Universalis.

"Thrid version of the mod"

# Description:
A year ago, The Sapa Inca Pachacuti was poisoned, everyone present was stunned, his personal guard could only take him to his personal room since he was still breathing, for three days, the gossips and whispers in Cuzco were anxious. On the fourth day, the Sapa Inca Pachacuti woke up. There was a fleeting rumor that the person who woke up was not the Sapa Inca. Despite this, during the seventh day there were no longer any rumors of any kind about his poisoning, since the prolonged meetings with his men, The extensive lessons given to all types of people, the disappearance of several nobles and priests spread much more gossip throughout the land. The Sapa Inca is no longer the same, he does not have the same look some would say, others would comment on each new change in his actions, as if the light long sleep has improved him.

-- The truth is that whoever resides in the consciousness of the Sapa Inca is a man of the 21st century, widely endowed with enough knowledge to terrify even someone from his own time. --
